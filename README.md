# Prescribed

## Intro

The Covid-19 pandemic has brought a prevalent medical problem into the spotlight, Health Literacy. Misinformation on solutions and medicine has endangered the lives of many and scaled back governmental efforts to solve this global problem. Simple, easy to understand instructions, advice and explanations are needed in order to bridge the barriers between doctors and their patients greatly assisting the medical process and helping users gain trust in this system. Furthermore, social distancing and worldwide lockdown measures have increased the need for automation in many daily medical procedures. Our applications aim to provide the most comprehensive technological solution in regards to helping the doctor in the processes of diagnosing, assisting and prescribing the patient for all services. Using camera optical sensors we are able to detect inflammation levels of rashes as well as forms to help assist in the diagnosing procedure. Doctors can use our application to prescribe medications online in a secure manner. Our neural algorithms will use this information to provide our patient more information on the diagnosis, possible remedies and a detailed list of measures needed to be taken. Clients are also recommended places to venture for treatment clinics and to order equipment and medication. All medical information including health records, X-ray scans and doctor conversations will be encrypted through a blockchain operated platform. Our innovative service will be the ONLY comprehensive platform to target all the key sectors of the telemedicine industry.

Our app addresses a few issues regarding the problem of health literacy. First and foremost, people confront a complex and potentially overwhelming set of health messages from many different sources that may be conflicting, biased, and misleading. By allowing doctors to hand select and assign articles and other media to their patients, we are able to ensure that the information is authoritative and accurate. Second, most patients see multiple doctors. According to a survey conducted by PR Newswire, the average number of doctors seen for all survey participants was 18.7. Our app organizes prescriptions from all doctors into one place for the patient. This makes it more convenient for them to look through. Finally, since most doctors have very limited time to communicate with patients, especially in asian countries, we included a chatbot that could address their questions and help reduce the information gap between the patient and doctor.

## Key Features

The two main tangible features of our product is the chatbot and the ability for doctors to prescribe resources. The chatbot provides patients a real-time customized question answering service. Getting information from doctor’s notes and analysing the articles selected by doctors from authorized websites, the bot will be able to explain some basic concepts and the descriptions of the patient’s situation. It will not only give patients a better understanding of what they are facing since the textualized unlimited questions the bot can offer, but also increase the time efficiency for doctors who aim to spend more time addressing problems other than explaining. Additionally, our product provides doctors a platform to prescribe resources. Most commonly, doctors prescribe medicine, therapy or diet. We allow them to extend it to address the health literacy problem by prescribing resources. Doctors can write notes, select articles and videos, create common disease solution templates and patients will have access to the resources by interacting with the chatbot.

## Innovation

Currently, in order to solve this problem, doctors make nurses memorize specific cases. When a patient asks a certain question, the doctor tells the nurse which case the patient is asking about, and makes the nurse explain the answer of that case to the patient. This is inefficient for both doctors and nurses, as doctors need to identify each case and communicate to the nurse, the nurse needs to recite redundant pieces of information several times a day.

While online medical examination services such as Teladoc do provide medical chatbots as well as places where doctors can send links that contain information about medications/illnesses, these services are targeted towards online examinations only.
